# HowTo 2D Games

one of the drawbacks of Godot, and many other modern, general use game engines, is that there are so many features that just aren't relevant to the kinds of simple, 2D games that I want to make. This topic is for notes about how to actually make the kinds of games I want, cutting through the fog of all the other features and whatnot.

What kinds of games am I talking about? For the most part, what I need is:

-   Simple sprite handling
-   Collision detection
-   Animation
-   Tile map backgrounds

Which means all the stull to support physics and kinematics and particle effects, and so on are just needless confusion for me.
