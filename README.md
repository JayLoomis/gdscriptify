Notes on using GD script, the language of the Godot Game Engine

Godot (pronounced "go dot" not "guh-DOH") is a multiplatform game engine that
works well for 2D and 3D game development. Because the authors had a unique
vision for the architecture of the engine, they wanted a scripting language that
could support that vision. They ended up making their own language, GDScript.
This project is my repository for notes about the language and Godot scripting.
